These are maps of smoke day cells, high/likely high smoke PM cells, and trajectory-overlapping cells on dates where smoke data is not available online. They should all be entirely NA. For now, I've been using the old smoke PM calculated where missing smoke dates are treated as non-smoke days, which is incorrect. This is just to check the maps on these dates for now.
